Authorization/Flask (Day 68)

 - Level 1 Authentication
	-password stored as plain text
	-password stored in server, not html

-Level 2 Authentication
	-encryption: scrambled password
	-need key to unlock

-Level 3 Authentication
	-hashing!
	-no need for key
	-hash function: mathematical equation that makes it almost impossible to go back into a password once encrypted
	* user enters pw, pw gets hashed and hash compared to previous hashes
	* hash is always the same (MD5)

-How to Hack A PW
	-make a hash table, compare hashes
	-dictionary attack…common words etc.

-Level 4 Authentication
	*salting- auto generated random set of characters added on top before hash!
	-bcrypt!!
		—> stronger hashing algorithm than MD5
		—> takes much longer to decrypt!
			* salt rounds- reapplying salt after hash then repeating the process a certain number of times.
		—> each new round doubles amount of time to decrypt 
		—> single factor that you can change each year to update the strength of your encryption
